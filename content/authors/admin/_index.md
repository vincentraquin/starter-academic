Welcome!

This website is dedicated to my profesional activites as a researcher.

My research focuses on host-microbe interactions in animals, from the characterization of natural host-associated microbial diversity to the identification of host, microbial and environmental factors that impact microbe transmission dynamics. I am mostly interested in vector-borne diseases with an emphasis in mosquito-arbovirus interactions: How arbovirus are maintained in the wild? Why do they emerge? What is the dynamic of virus transmission between the host and the vector? 

To answer these questions, I combine fieldwork (vector collection, virus detection), experimental approach (microbiology, vector biology) and modeling (intra-host/vecor and inter-host/vector modelisation of virus transmission).

This work is possible thanks to amazing collaborators, and I am always open for new and exciting collaborations so feel free to contact me.

As a member of labs supported by several public agencies, views expressed here are my own.
